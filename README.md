## Introduction

AWFUL is a simple functional language designed and implemented for didactic purposed.

The ideas presented in the language stem essentially from PJ Landin papers in the '60s.

The language provides the bare minimum equipment for a functional one:

- atomic data types: numbers and strings
- lists.
- function data types with static scoping.

The language comes with a representation syntax and a description syntax: the latter is the inner form in which language expressions are handled and evaluated.
